Thank you! In this individual response, we will refer back to the main points discussed in the global response where relevant and discuss any other specific points the reviewer has raised. Below we will go through individual points where quotations trace back to reviewer remarks.

#### Summary

The reviewer has nicely summarised our work and we are happy to see that the main messages of the paper evidently came across. We also appreciate the mentioning of "honest acknowledgment of method limitations" as one of the strengths of the paper, which has indeed been important to us. 

#### Citation of Welling \& Teh (2011)

> "It may be good to add a citation to [Welling & Teh, 2011] for SGLD on line 144."

Regarding the specific question/suggestion raised by the reviewer, we do actually cite Welling \& Teh (2011) in line 145, but we can move that up to line 144 to make it clearer. 

#### Need for gradient-access

> "Need for gradient access, e.g. through autodiff, for black-box model under investigation."

This is indeed a limitation of our approach, although it is worth pointing out that many of the existing state-of-the-art approaches to CE rely on gradient access. We do have a paragraph on this in section 7, but are happy to expand on this to the extent possible.
