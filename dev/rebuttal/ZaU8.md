Thank you! In this individual response, we will refer back to the main points discussed in the global response where relevant and discuss any other specific points the reviewer has raised.

The reviewer has nicely summarised our work and we are happy to see that the main messages of the paper evidently came across. We also appreciate the mentioning of `honest acknowledgment of method limitations' as one of the strengths of the paper, which has indeed been important to us. 

Regarding the specific question/suggestion raised by the reviewer, we do actually cite Welling \& Teh (2011) in line 145, but we can move that up to line 144 to make it clearer. 

Many thanks!
