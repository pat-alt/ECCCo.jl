These are two important characteristics of Split Conformal Prediction (SCP) that make it particularly useful in the context of Algorithmic Recourse. Firstly, the fact that SCP involves posthoc calibration steps that happen after training, ensures that we need not place any restrictions on the black-box model itself. This stands in contrast to the approach proposed by @schut2021generating in which they essentially restrict the class of models to Bayesian models. Secondly, the fact that the model itself is kept entirely intact ensures that the generated counterfactuals maintain fidelity to the model. Finally, note that we also have not resorted to a surrogate model to learn more about $X \\sim \\mathcal{X}$. Instead, we have used the fitted model itself and a calibration data set to learn about the model's predictive uncertainty. \n",
